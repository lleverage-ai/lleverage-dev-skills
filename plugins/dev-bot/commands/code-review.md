Provide a code review for the given pull request using inline comments.

Arguments:
- `--force` or `-f`: Skip eligibility checks and always provide a review

## Steps

1. **Eligibility check** (skip if `--force`): Use a Haiku agent to check if the PR is closed or already has your review. Draft PRs are allowed.

2. **Fetch PR details**: Get the PR diff and metadata using `gh pr view` and `gh pr diff`.

3. **Review the changes**: Launch 2 parallel Sonnet agents:
   - **Agent 1 (Logic & Bugs)**: Scan for logic errors, bugs, edge cases, and incorrect assumptions
   - **Agent 2 (Security & Best Practices)**: Check for security issues, race conditions, and anti-patterns

   Each agent returns issues with: file path, line number, category, description, and suggested fix if applicable.

4. **Filter issues**: Keep only high-confidence issues (score 75+). Discard:
   - Pre-existing issues (not introduced by this PR)
   - Linter/type errors (CI will catch these)
   - Nitpicks a senior engineer wouldn't mention
   - Intentional changes related to the PR's purpose

5. **Validate issues**: For each remaining issue, launch a parallel Haiku agent to validate it's not a false positive. The agent should:
   - Re-read the relevant code context
   - Verify the issue is real and introduced by this PR
   - Check if it's actually a bug vs intentional behavior
   - Score confidence 0-100

   Discard any issue scoring below 80. Common false positives:
   - Code that looks wrong but is correct in context
   - Issues already handled elsewhere in the codebase
   - Stylistic concerns disguised as bugs
   - Changes that are intentional based on PR description

6. **Post review with inline comments**: Use the GitHub API to submit a review:

   a. Create inline comments for each issue using `gh api`:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews \
     -f event="COMMENT" \
     -f body="..." \
     -f 'comments[][path]=file.ts' \
     -f 'comments[][line]=42' \
     -f 'comments[][body]=...'
   ```

   b. For issues with suggested fixes, use GitHub's suggestion syntax in the comment body:
   ~~~
   **logic**: Description of the issue

   ```suggestion
   corrected code here
   ```
   ~~~
